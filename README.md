# FinalProject-Group8
There are several draft coding files in "Code" folder. 
First, all team members did EDA analysis individually and thus we have EDA files for each one of us and at the end compiled it together to one EDA_final.py.
Next, we did preprocessing and modeling in individual code file to find the best outcomes, thus we have several modelling files as well.
We tried pca seperately from our main file, just to see if it gives better outcome, but it did not so we discard that option.
At the very end of coding, we combined all the codings into one file and named it modelling_final2_apr30.py.
In order to see the full coding for our project, please refer to modelling_final2_apr30.py file. Thank you.
